            Corruption in college sports: Paying athletes is not the solution, but allowing endorsements might be.
            <br><br>

            “The NCAA is really fucked up. Everybody’s making money except the players. We’re
            the ones waking up early as hell to be the best teams and do everything they want us to do. And
            then the players get nothing. They say education, but if I’m there for a year, I can’t get much
            education.”

            <br><br>

            These are the words of NBA star Ben Simmons in the HBO documentary <i>One and Done</i>, which chronicles 
            Simmons’ journey from being a young basketball prodigy in Australia to coming to the U.S. and attending 
            Louisiana State University before finally realizing his dream of joining the NBA. The documentary 
            highlights, among other things, aspects of college sports which many consider to be clear weaknesses 
            and failures by universities and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). These include 
            the lack of pay for stars like Simmons, who generate millions of dollars for their respective 
            universities; the corruption that takes place in both academic and financial contexts; and the 
            hypocrisy of universities and the NCAA, who label these stars ‘student-athletes’ even though 
            they often seem more like employees than students. Many argue that high-profile college athletes, 
            particularly the ones who participate in lucrative sports like football and basketball, are being 
            exploited because they make practically nothing compared to the amount of money they generate, and 
            they have a strong case when one considers that the NCAA 
            <a href="https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2018/03/07/ncaa-1-billion-revenue" target="_blank">
            reportedly generated over a billion dollars from college sports in 2017</a>
            while the athletes were not paid except through scholarships.
            
            <br><br>

            However, it is also important to note that most college athletes do not fit into this category. 
            According to the NCAA, <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Recruiting%20Fact%20Sheet%20WEB.pdf" 
            target="_blank">only two percent </a> of college athletes in major sports like 
            basketball, football, and baseball go on to become professional athletes, and only a handful of this group 
            consistently makes headlines and attracts national media attention. For the vast majority of 
            Division I athletes, college sports offer a pretty good deal: scholarships, which often cover 
            one’s full tuition and fees, along with the opportunity to compete in one’s respective sport. 
            Of course, this is assuming that the athletes receive a quality education, which, after observing
            scandals like the one involving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/sports/unc-north-carolina-ncaa.html" target="_blank">fake classes at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, 
            is a big assumption to make; if the NCAA is going to continue using the term ‘student-athlete’ 
            to refer to college athletes, then it must work with universities to ensure that such scandals 
            do not occur in the future and that college athletes actually receive a quality education. One 
            can also benefit from other perks that comes with being a college athlete, including access to 
            alumni networks, the potential ability to impress employers with one’s experience as a college 
            athlete, and sometimes even fame. Even those who do pursue professional sports can benefit from 
            the system; one name that comes to mind is C.J. McCollum, an NBA player who earned his degree 
            in journalism at LeHigh University and <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/cj-mccollum-portland-trailblazers-why-journalism-matters" target="_blank">
            continues to be actively involved in journalism</a> today. 
            For people like McCollum, universities offer a mutually-beneficial agreement in which they 
            profit off of the student-athletes who, in return, receive a free education and the opportunity
            to compete in their respective sports.

            <br><br>

            However, for the minute minority of college athletes like Ben Simmons, who are largely responsible 
            for the exorbitant amounts of money generated by college sports, the current system is unfair because
            television networks, universities, the NCAA, and seemingly everyone else involved in college sports 
            profit off of them while they make nothing. While some university sports programs <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/schools-most-revenue-college-sports-2016-10/#25-ucla--969-million-1" target="_blank">make upwards of one 
            hundred million dollars annually</a>, mostly from their basketball and football teams, the players 
            do not receive any of it. This is especially concerning when some of these athletes feel forced to 
            go to college because they are not allowed to play professionally immediately after high school. 
            For example, the NBA has a policy often called the “one-and-done” rule, which requires one to be at
            least nineteen years old to enter. The NFL has an even stricter rule, which states the following: 
            “To be eligible for the draft, players must have been out of high school for at least three years 
            and must have used up their college eligibility before the start of the next college football season.”
            Some argue that basketball players have the choice to play overseas or join the G League, which is 
            the NBA’s minor league intended for potential NBA players. But most successful NBA players come from
            college basketball, which best allows for one to gain national media attention and increase one’s 
            draft stock, and it would be seen as a compromise for many to pursue anything other than college 
            basketball after high school. However, at least basketball players have alternatives; football 
            players have no alternatives: college is the only option.

            <br><br>

            For many of these athletes, the current system of college athletics is not mutually-beneficial because
            they are receiving much less in return for what they bring to their universities. This is even when
            accounting for the price of four years worth of tuition and fees, which is at most roughly a quarter 
            of a million dollars—a mere sliver of the amount of money these athletes generate. However, often 
            times star athletes do not stay for all four years because they want to play professionally as soon 
            as they can. At one point in the documentary <i>One and Done</i>, Ben Simmons states, “I’m not going to class
            next semester because I don’t need to. I’m here to play, I’m not here to go to school.” And it is 
            difficult to blame him. After all, he had no intentions of staying for more than one year because
            he knew he was headed for the NBA, where he now makes millions of dollars. He was only at college 
            to fulfill the NBA’s “one-and-done” rule, generating millions for LSU while receiving none of it. 
            Meanwhile, LSU pretended like he was a ‘student-athlete’ even though it knew full well that this 
            was a lie. Simmons sums up his experience being on the receiving end of this hypocrisy: “Everybody
            knows who I am because LSU [markets] me and put me everywhere. They’re gonna treat me like I’m a 
            superstar and then the next day say that you’re not, you’re just another student-athlete. They 
            can’t expect me to act like everybody else if they don’t treat me like everybody else.” If 
            universities are going to continue exploiting star athletes like Simmons, they ought to admit it 
            instead of hiding behind the guise that they are no different than the rest of the college athlete
            population.

            <br><br>

            Clearly, something ought to be done to better compensate these athletes, but there are different ways 
            of doing so. Some argue that the solution is for universities to pay them as a means of compensation, 
            but this would present countless more issues to address. One immediate consequence would be that 
            universities would have less resources to invest on other areas of their respective campuses. This 
            would be in addition to the amount they already invest on sports, which can sometimes be ludicrously
            high. (One need look no further than the renovations done on Texas A&M’s Kyle Field, which <a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2016/01/13/kyle-field-redevelopment-came-in-on-time-and-under-budget/" target="_blank">cost roughly half a billion dollars</a>
            and was considered “under budget.”) Things become even more complicated when 
            trying to determine the amount of money that the athletes be paid. Would athletes who compete in 
            high-revenue sports like basketball and football be paid more than those who compete in other sports? 
            Or would all athletes be paid the same amount, regardless of sport? If basketball and football players
            were to be paid more, then those who compete in other sports would likely protest to this, arguing 
            that they are being unfairly treated. The basketball and football players would contend that they
            should be paid more because they bring in more money for their universities. Each side presents a 
            strong case; thus, we find ourselves in a hopeless dilemma: which side should we choose? 
            Unfortunately, both paths lead to more questions without clear answers.

            <br><br>

            If athletes were to be paid equally, then it would be uncertain how much they ought to be paid. Would 
            the NCAA decide on a set number for all athletes? Or would individual universities determine an amount 
            for only their student-athletes? If the former were to occur, it would be unclear whether or not there 
            ought to be distinctions in pay among Division I, II, and III athletes. In the latter scenario, 
            universities with greater endowments would have an unfair advantage because they would be able to pay 
            their athletes more and, thus, attract top recruits to play for them. It could be argued, however, that
            this would not solve the issue of parity since only a handful of universities, especially those in the
            major sports conferences like the SEC, Big Ten, Pac-12, and ACC currently dominate most collegiate 
            sports anyway.

            <br><br>

            Paying athletes unequally would also present difficult issues. For instance, it would be unclear if
            there ought to be a difference in pay among individual athletes who compete in the same sports. Some 
            would argue for this disparity because individual players often vary in their contributions to the 
            overall revenue their teams generate. For example, a star quarterback will often attract more of the 
            media’s attention than his teammates on defense. But others would argue that those on defense 
            contribute just as much to their team’s success and deserve equal pay even though they do not 
            receive as much attention. Another factor to consider is the potential effect this would have on 
            athletes’ relationships with one another, both within and across sports. Differences in pay would 
            likely create drama and conflict which could potentially disrupt locker rooms and even affect a 
            team’s overall performance. Paying athletes, unequally or not, would also further alienate them 
            from the rest of the student body, which many would be against.

            <br><br>

            All these questions have something in common: they are completely arbitrary and have no clear solution. 
            Universities and the NCAA would receive backlash from athletes, the media, and the general public no 
            matter which way they were to proceed. And while this is to be expected for any change to occur, 
            realistically there would be far too many challenges to face to accommodate such a small percentage
            of the college athlete population, and this is before even considering potential repercussions due 
            to <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/inclusion/title-ix-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">Title IX</a>. A component of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, Title IX states that “No person in
            the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the 
            benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving 
            Federal financial assistance.” Title IX is often <a href="http://www.excellesports.com/news/lawsuits-title-ix-womens-sports/" target="_blank">applied to various gender discrimination cases</a> in 
            college athletics, and it would almost certainly be applied to the case of paying college athletes 
            if they were to be paid differently based on the revenue generated by their respective sports, which
            would favor men’s sports. However, even though paying college athletes may not be a feasible solution,
            this does not mean that the NCAA should not explore other options of compensating athletes who are 
            not being adequately rewarded for their services.

            <br><br>
            A more promising solution would be to allow college athletes to sign endorsement deals. Stars like Ben 
            Simmons would be paid, and universities would not have to pay a dime. Rather than universities or the
            NCAA deciding on the amount, the brands providing the endorsements would be able to decide how much to 
            pay the athletes based on what they deem to be appropriate, just like how they sign endorsement deals
            with professional athletes. There would be no issue of determining who ought to get paid because only 
            the athletes whom brands would want to sign deals with would get the deals. Universities would still 
            be able to give out scholarships like usual, and the system would remain largely unaffected. Some may
            argue that this would also lead to issues with Title IX, which may be true, but at least universities
            would not be the ones paying the athletes in this case. Of course, there would still be challenges 
            with this method, but it would also avoid many of the problems that come with paying college 
            athletes directly.

            <br><br>
            No matter which approach universities were to take, it would be difficult to enact changes in policy 
            to reward star athletes beyond providing scholarships. But regardless, something must be done. 
            Fortunately, there seems to be hope within the realm of basketball, as there have been recent steps 
            toward abolishing the NBA’s “one-and-done” rule by 2022, although <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25032283/nba-nbpa-talks-ending-one-done-facing-final-hurdle" target="_blank">recent discussions have been met with obstacles</a>
            , and the G League is developing a new one year program that would pay top recruits 
            $125,000 and allow them to sign endorsement deals. However, while these are positive steps forward
            and other professional sports leagues should follow suit, the NCAA and universities are still 
            responsible for their malpractices. To address the multitude of issues surrounding college athletics,
            the NCAA and universities must first acknowledge their roles in perpetuating these problems and 
            strive to serve college athletes in a way that aligns with their goals. Only then will there be 
            any hope of solving them.
