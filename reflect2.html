            What are you proudest of in Project II? Why?
            <br>
            <i>I like how my paper considers many different factors associated with<br>the issue of whether college athletes ought to be paid and addresses their complexities.<br>I think this makes the paper more convincing.</i>
            <br><br>
            If you came back to Project II in a month to revise it, what would you strengthen/deepen/edit for?
            <br>
            <i>I would look into potentially incorporating more narrative evidence into the paper rather than just the Ben Simmons documentary.</i>
            <br><br>
            Which writing strategies and readings/videos/guest speakers in the past month have been especially interesting?
            <br>
            <i>I liked the writing strategy of incorporating narratives into a piece. I also liked getting to hear<br>the guest speakers talk about their writing processes. I liked the part about ethos and logos also.</i>
