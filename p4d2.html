            A Popular Revival: Fighting Tradition in the Midst of Golf’s Decline

       <p>
        Once an active golf course, Apple Ridge Country Club, which opened in 1966 in
        Mahwah, New Jersey, is now an abandoned plot of land being <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/02/18/toll-brothers-set-break-ground-78-home-project/97894592/" target="_blank">used as a construction site</a>
        for a 78-home project. It is just one of over 800 golf courses in the U.S. 
        that have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-two-abandoned-golf-courses-2017-6#apple-ridge-country-club-is-just-one-example-of-the-decline-in-active-golfers-in-the-state-of-new-jersey-between-2006-and-2014-the-number-of-new-jersey-state-golf-association-members-dropped-by-10-6" target="_blank">shut down</a> over the past dozen or so years and a manifestation of a 
        general decline in the game throughout that time period. There were 28.8 million 
        golfers in the U.S. in 2000 and 30 million in 2005 (O’Brien), but this number 
        steadily decreased over time: “According to the National Golf Foundation, there 
        were...26.1 million in 2010, 25.5 in 2011 and 25.3 million in 2012” (O’Brien). 
        Since then, this number has decreased further to 23.8 million in 2016 (National
        Golf Foundation, 2017). Herbert Hainer, former CEO of Adidas, which <a href="https://www.golf.com/equipment/2017/05/12/everything-you-need-know-about-taylormade-sale-were-afraid-ask" target="_blank">sold</a> 
        Taylormade—one of the leading golf club manufacturers in the past decade—to KPS
        Capital Partners in 2017, acknowledged that “A decline in the number of active 
        players…caused immense problems in the entire industry, and as a market leader,
        this hit [them] particularly hard” (Harwell 2015). The overarching reason for
        this decline is simple: people are simply less interested in golf. But there 
        are various reasons why this has been the case.
       </p>

       <p>
        Pete Cowen, who runs a golf academy in England and has worked with professional 
        golfers including Sergio Garcia and Henrik Stenson, says this: “Golf is in danger,
        but the solutions are clear: We must be more family-orientated, and cheaper. I don’t
        think there is any doubt at all that golf is nowhere as inclusive as it needs to be” (Morgan, 2018).
        Here, he addresses the issue that golf is too exclusive for many due to a variety of
        factors such as cost. The cost to play a round of golf, typically referred to as 
        “green fees,” can vary depending on the course and general location. For example, 
        a round at Torrey Pines Golf Course—a course based in San Diego, California and one
        of the highest-regarded public courses in the United States—costs $122 at the time 
        this paper was written, whereas a round at Stone Creek Golf Club, a course based in
        Oregon City, Oregon, can cost less than $30. Green fees may or may not include the
        cost to use a golf cart, which could add another fifteen dollars or more,
        depending on the course. There are also costs associated with clubs, shoes, 
        balls, and apparel, which combined could cost upwards of a thousand dollars 
        assuming one buys the latest equipment. For many, these costs simply make 
        playing golf unaffordable and unjustified when they could easily find cheaper
        alternatives to spend their leisure time on.
       </p>

            <figcaption class="n">Torrey Pines Golf Course (Source: Golf Advisor)</figcaption>
        </figure>

       <p>
        Another factor is the amount of time it takes to play a round of golf; one round of 
        eighteen holes can take more than four hours, depending on pace of play and the length 
        of the course, and many simply cannot afford to spend this much time. Jack Nicklaus, 
        one of the greatest golfers the game has ever seen, says this: “I’d like to play a
        game that can take place in three hours...I’d quite like to play a game that I can 
        get some reasonable gratification out of very quickly” (Harwell, 2015). Of course, 
        this does not apply to driving ranges, where people can spend however much time they 
        want; it is an issue solely with respect to playing a round of golf on a course.
       </p>

       <p>
        Cowen also points to the traditions that the game of golf holds onto, such as the 
        tendency of courses to require players to wear golf shoes: “We need to do whatever 
        it takes. Let the kids wear trainers, let them play computer games in the clubhouse.
        Most kids don’t even have shoes, let alone golf shoes. It’s ridiculous.” This can be
        an obstacle for many who want to play golf but do not have golf shoes because golf 
        shoes cost money, oftentimes upwards of one hundred dollars. The same can be said 
        about other forms of dress codes such as requiring collared shirts. (Unlike golf 
        shoes, many people already have collared shirts. However, this does not help to 
        promote an inclusive environment because it emits a sense of prestige that is often
        stereotypically associated with golf.) These are examples of how holding onto
        tradition can limit golf’s growth: considering that it is perfectly viable to 
        play golf in sneakers and a tee shirt, requiring golfers to abide to these kinds
        of dress codes does not make sense—at least at public golf courses—and only 
        narrows the game’s audience. At private country clubs which have members, this
        may not be as much of a problem since the clubs are self-selecting and often 
        include wealthy individuals who can afford to buy golf apparel.
       </p>

       <p>
        To combat its decline, the game of golf must address these issues. And while tackling
        the issues of cost and time may be particularly troublesome, the game of golf already 
        has an example of what challenging tradition looks like; one need look no further than
        Tiger Woods’ impact on the game.
       </p>

    <p>
        When Tiger Woods first entered the professional golf scene in the summer of 1996, 
        golf simply was not cool. But the public’s perception of golf changed soon after.
        Chris Riley, former Ryder Cup teammate of Woods, says this: “‘At sports bars now,
        people will watch golf, especially if Tiger is playing. Even if he's not playing.
        But pre-1996, nobody watched golf unless you were a golfer.’” Orin Starn, a cultural 
        anthropology professor at Duke University,says the following in his book The Passion
        of Tiger Woods: “Tiger embodied a kind of modern cool that golf hadn’t seen
        before...This was to a certain degree, and still is, a bland, vanilla sport played
        by anonymous white guys who all dress the same and look the same. So to have this
        charismatic, young African-American-Asian-American hybrid figure bursting onto 
        the scene made huge news” (Williams, 2017). In his differences as well as his
        talent, Tiger was defying the game’s traditions and making the game more appealing 
        to others in the process.

    <p>
        This was especially the case with respect to younger audiences, including some of today’s young stars.
        In an <a href="https://www.independent.ie/sport/golf/paul-kimmage-meets-rory-mcilroy-the-truth-about-the-olympics-close-friendship-with-tiger-and-the-important-things-in-life-35349397.html" target="_blank">interview with the Irish 
        Independent</a>, Rory McIlroy had this to say about Woods: “I’m probably one of the
        biggest Tiger fans you will ever come across. I grew up watching him play and
        know all of his records. I remember going to play at Doral when I was eight 
        or nine—my first tournament over there—and being on the 18th fairway of the 
        ‘Blue Monster’ thinking: ‘Wow! Tiger has been here. He's been on the same 
        fairway!’ That sort of stuff. And all of a sudden you are shooting a 
        commercial with him.” Japanese talent Hideki Matsuyama also grew up idolizing
        Tiger: “‘Tiger was my hero growing up and still remains the man to 
        me,”’Matsuyama said. ‘When I would watch him on TV in Japan, I can 
        remember thinking that he was so good and so cool and his swing was so 
        pure. I vividly remember Tiger winning the U.S. Opens at Pebble Beach and 
        Torrey Pines. I remember trying to swing like him, but his swing was so
        good that I had no chance’” (PGA). Both McIlroy and Matsuyama, who are
        both among the PGA Tour’s young stars today, represent foreign 
        countries—Northern Ireland and Japan, respectively—and help promote 
        the game of golf abroad in addition to in the U.S. Thus, Tiger’s impact
        on the game’s demographics are not limited to age but include racial 
        diversity as well.<sup id="race1"><a href="p4d2.html#race2">1</a></sup> He similarly inspired many other young players, both
        professional and recreational, who make up today’s golfing population.
       </p>

       <p>
        Since his emergence, Tiger helped instigate golf’s rapid growth in the past couple
        of decades. Phil Mickelson <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/phil-mickelson-tiger-missed/story?id=23246074" target="_blank">attested to this</a> prior to the 2014 Masters, admitting 
        that he had benefited greatly from Tiger’s involvement in the game: “Look at what
        he's doing for the game the last 17 years he’s played as a professional. It's been 
        incredible,” Mickelson said. “I’ve told him, and I’ve said this before, nobody has
        benefited more from having Tiger in the game than myself.” He elaborated by
        explaining how the prize money at professional tournaments had increased
        significantly: “I remember when I was an amateur and I won my first tournament
        in Tucson in 1991, the entire purse was $1 million, first place was $180,000
        and Steve [Loy, my agent] and I would sit down and say, ‘I wonder if in my 
        lifetime, probably not in my career, we would...play for a $1 million 
        first-place check.’ [Now] it's every week. It's unbelievable the growth of 
        this game.” This increase in prize money was a direct result of the increased
        popularity of the game, with the amount of golfers in America peaking in the
        mid-2000’s.
    </p>

       <p>
        After 2009, Tiger was frequently absent from the game due to injuries and 
        off-the-course reasons, and golf’s popularity declined for various aforementioned
        reasons as well as Tiger’s lack of involvement in the game. (2013 was an exception,
        in which Tiger won five PGA Tour events and was named Player of the Year.) 
        Throughout this descent, the golfing world tried to find a successor to Tiger 
        Woods in the likes of Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy, but neither they nor any
        other golfer has been able to draw nearly as much attention to the game. This 
        is clear when considering the impact of Tiger’s return to the game in the 2018 
        PGA Tour season. Tiger returned after recovering from various surgeries, and he
        performed well in most of the tournaments he participated in, which all enjoyed 
        television ratings that were much higher than those of recent years.  When Tiger
        won the Tour Championship—his first victory since 2013—on September 23, 2018, 
        the broadcast “earned a 5.21 overnight rating, making it the highest-rated 
        telecast in the history of the FedExCup Playoffs and the highest-rated PGA Tour
        telecast in 2018 (excluding majors). The rating was up 206 percent over 2017’s
        Tour Championship” (Golf Channel). However, even ignoring the television 
        ratings, all one had to do was to observe the scene to understand that this
        moment was special.

        The sea of people behind him as he walked to the green to claim his victory—there 
        may never be anything else like it in the game of golf. There is simply no way that
        any other player could make something like that happen. But this is exactly the 
        problem: while Woods’ return has been fantastic for the game of golf, he will only
        be around for so long. The fact that the game has seen a resurgence—or at least an
        increase in energy—due to his return indicates that it still heavily relies on 
        him because other professional golfers simply do not attract the same level of
        viewership that he does. Instead of hoping that another player like Woods shows 
        up, the golfing world should learn from Tiger’s example by continuing to 
        challenge the traditions it holds onto, as this is clearly an effective way 
        of growing the game.
       </p>

       <p>
        There have already been certain instances in which this has occurred, such as the 
        emergence of Topgolf, which has managed to redefine the experience of visiting a
        driving range. Topgolf is a restaurant and driving range business which has 
        locations all across the United States as well as the United Kingdom. It offers a 
        unique experience in which one can hit balls into a field with various pin locations, 
        just like a typical driving range, while also enjoying food that you can order on the
        spot.            
       </p>

            <figcaption class="n">A typical booth at a Topgolf facility. (Source: Detroit Metro Times)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Topgolf has been a very successful business, making an estimated 300 million
            dollars in revenue in 2016 and quickly expanding (Indap, 2016), continually <a href="https://topgolf.com/us/locations/" target="_blank">adding more
            locations</a> such as one coming to San Jose. Through the modernization of its 
            facilities and its food services, Topgolf defies the traditional driving range
            experience while catering to younger audiences, providing a unique experience
            that more closely resembles a visit to the bowling alley than a visit to the
            golf course; one can simply go to a Topgolf facility with some friends, 
            order some beer, and have a good time hitting some balls. Topgolf does an 
            excellent job of making golf more appealing to the general public, and its 
            success illustrates that there is still a large market for golf despite
            its supposed decline.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another example is the United States Golf Association’s (USGA) new rules 
            changes, which make the game more inclusive by removing unjust penalties and 
            looking to improve pace of play. For example, <a href="http://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/rules/rules-and-decisions.html#!rule-17" target="_blank">Rule 17-3 states</a> that one’s ball
            cannot strike “The flagstick in the hold, unattended, when the stroke has been
            made on the putting green.” This forces players to remove the stick every 
            time they putt on the green, which takes additional time and effort and
            potentially slows pace of play. Additionally, this rule does not allow for 
            a player to use the flagstick as a backstop for a downhill putt, which could
            be beneficial in certain situations. Currently, if a player violates this 
            rule, then that player incurs a two stroke penalty. The USGA decided, 
            however, to make a <a href="http://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/rules-hub/rules-modernization/major-changes/ball-played-from-the-putting-green-hits-unattended-flagstick-in-hole.html" target="_blank">change to this rule</a> which will now allow players to 
            keep the flagstick in the hole at all times if they desire. It has also 
            made <a href="http://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/rules-hub/rules-modernization/major-changes/major-changes.html#equipment" target="_blank">significant revisions</a> to various other rules, all of which will take
            effect in 2019. These changes were motivated by hopes to improve the 
            game and are a constructive acknowledgement that the game is not perfect.
            The USGA should continue to actively seek out ways to make the game more 
            enjoyable and appealing to both beginners and enthusiasts.

            Youth programs like The First Tee and Youth on Course seek to introduce younger
            audiences to the game of golf, helping to defy the notion that golf is a game 
            meant for older people. <a href="https://thefirsttee.org/" target="_blank">The First Tee</a> is an organization founded in 1997 whose
            “mission is to impact the lives of young people by providing educational 
            programs that build character, instill life-enhancing values and promote
            healthy choices through the game of golf.” The First Tee provides various
            programs at golf courses, elementary schools, and youth centers, and it
            has worked with over 15 million youth since its inception.

        </figure>

        <p>
            Founded in 2006, <a href="https://youthoncourse.org/" target="_blank">Youth on Course</a> is non-profit organization which “complements The First 
            Tee by providing members additional opportunities.” It is partnered with
            over nine hundred golf courses across the nation to encourage more youth
            to play golf, providing a membership program that allows golfers between
            ages six to eighteen to play a full round of golf for only five dollars,
            and it also provides internship and caddying programs as well as 
            college scholarships. It currently has over 45,000 members. The 
            program cost varies depending on the state, ranging from five dollars
            in Michigan to thirty dollars in Oregon, and the membership lasts 
            for an entire calendar year. This is an effective way to encourage
            more youth to play golf because it dramatically decreases the high 
            costs associated with green fees, thus eliminating that obstacle 
            for many of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite these efforts to make the game of golf more appealing to the public, 
            particularly younger audiences, some difficult challenges remain, and it is 
            not clear how they ought to be addressed. One of these challenges is the high
            cost for adult golfers, which is a difficult problem to address since golf 
            courses need to pay off the various costs associated with maintaining the 
            course and paying employees. Another is the large amount of time it takes
            to play a full round of golf, which is often a direct result of the fact
            that a full-length golf course will universally have eighteen holes. Peter 
            Thomson, Australian professional golfer and five-time Open Championship 
            winner, <a href="http://www.why18holes.com/why-we-play-18.html" target="_blank">explains the reason</a> behind this strict standard: “If you accept
            that the Old Course at St. Andrews is [the] original course (and there 
            is precious little argument), then all courses created since are to some
            degree copies. We build in good faith, courses of 18 holes (and not 15
            or 20) in emulation of the original. We build sand bunkers in the 
            mountains of Japan or in the swamps of Florida only because we are 
            trying to copy the Old Course and its features.” 
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
            The root cause of 
            the long rounds is that the game held onto the notion of eighteen holes
            as a gold standard of how all courses ought to be when, in reality, it
            was just convenient for that course in particular. This eventually 
            became the norm for the entire sport, which is why seemingly all 
            full-sized golf courses have eighteen holes today. The problem is
            that eighteen holes is not ideal for many courses due to the
            associated land requirements and maintenance costs, which are 
            often less-than-ideal and sometimes even unfeasible. If it was 
            not for this convention that the golfing world has taken for 
            granted, then courses could have the number of holes that is 
            appropriate for each of them, which could help with maintenance 
            costs and overall productivity.

            that golf courses eliminate holes as they see fit, likely a handful of holes 
            for each course for which doing so would be beneficial. Roald lists out some 
            potential benefits, including the following: this would decrease the amount 
            of time to play a full round, which would likely attract more people to play;
            this would decrease course maintenance costs, thus saving money; the course 
            could sell the extra land that used to be occupied by the removed holes and 
            make quick cash; the extra land could be used for other purposes, such as
            public recreation and the preservation of wildlife; and this would reduce 
            the negative environmental impact that comes with irrigation and fertilizer
            usage. Additionally, while Roald does not mention this, another potential 
            benefit is that courses would potentially be able to decrease their green 
            fees due to the decreased maintenance costs, which would help to address the
            cost issue for adult golfers who do not benefit from various youth 
            initiatives. Of course, this idea would not be imposed on courses that
            did not want to enact these changes themselves, but it is a suggestion 
            for courses that could benefit from it; therefore, more established 
            courses would not be affected at all, and competitive tournaments could 
            still be hosted at these eighteen-hole courses. The primary challenge 
            this proposal faces is that it would change golf’s deeply rooted tradition
            of having strictly eighteen holes constitute a complete golf course, 
            which would be difficult to do since golfers are already used to this
            convention. However, it is a promising solution that golf courses and 
            golfers alike should strongly consider.

            Golf is on the decline, and more courses will share the same fate as Apple
            Ridge Country Club unless something is done to make the game more appealing. 
            And while some efforts have already been made, there are many more things that
            can be done, especially with respect to making the game more affordable and 
            take less time out of one’s day. These efforts are particularly crucial in the
            wake of Tiger Woods’ return to golf and the reality that the game’s
            popularity still heavily depends on Woods despite the plethora of young 
            talent on the PGA Tour today, who do not draw nearly as much excitement
            and attention, because he will not be around forever. Enacting change 
            would likely require challenging established traditions to make golf more
            appealing to wider audiences, which could mean redefining some aspects
            of the game like the number of holes. And some would undoubtedly oppose
            this change, especially the die-hard traditionalists. But perhaps it 
            is time for the golfing world to acknowledge that the reason for the 
            game’s decline just might be this refusal to change, this clinging 
            onto tradition at all costs, and that maybe the only way forward is 
            to let go.

            <sup>1</sup>Even though the stereotypical golfer in most people’s minds today is an old, 
            white male, many golfers do not fit this description. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/761977/us-golf-player-demographics-age-groups/" target="_blank">survey data found on Statista</a>
            , approximately 12.1 percent of golfers in the U.S. are
            between ages 6 and 17, 15.8 percent are between 18 and 29, 20.2 percent 
            are between 30 and 49, and 15.5 percent are between 40 and 49. The survey 
            was conducted in 2016 and had 30,000 responses, and a golfer was define as 
            someone who played at least one round of golf in 2016. This evidence suggests
            that the majority of golfers in America are actually younger than 50 years 
            old, comprising 63.6 percent of the U.S. golfing population—contrary to the
            aforementioned stereotype. (If we define “old” to be 40 or older, this 
            number is still 48.1 percent.) Additionally, according to the 2016 U.S.
            Golf Economy Report conducted by the National Golf Foundation, approximately
            a quarter of all American golfers are women, and approximately one fifth 
            of American golfers are non-Caucasian. Considering that about 76.6 percent
            of the U.S. population is white <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217#qf-headnote-a" target="_blank">as of July 2017</a>, the racial demographics
            of golfers roughly mirror the racial demographics of the U.S. population,
            at least in terms of the Caucasian versus non-Caucasian contrast. Thus,
            even though the stereotype of golf’s demographics may be true in that 
            the majority of golfers are white, it does not capture the reality of
            the American golfing population as a whole.
