            What useful skills and techniques did you develop during the Project III work?
            <br>
            <i>I learned how to embed images and videos in an HTML file. I also got to experience interviewing someone, which helped me to develop various interviewing skills like coming up with questions, coming up with follow-up questions, and writing an edited interview script.</i>
            <br><br>
            How do you know that you’ve gotten stronger as a writer/reader/thinker in the past month?
            <br>
            <i>I think Project III helped me to think outside of the box and to think more about my audience’s needs. For example, since it involved multimodal evidence like images and videos, I had to consider what types of images and videos would be useful for my audience. I also had to take into account that many people might not know a lot of video game terminology and add various definitions when appropriate.
            Project II also helped me to improve as a writer and thinker because I was able to consider many different nuances related to the issue I addressed in the paper, which required a lot of thought but was also useful to make my argument more compelling.</i>
            <br><br>
            What would you like to focus on improving over the final month and a half as a writer, researcher, and critical thinker?
            <br>
            <i>I want to improve in my creative writing skills. I am much more used to writing informational and persuasive pieces in a formal way that is often taught in traditional English classes. But I also want to improve as a creative writer by being willing to take some risks and engage the audience more.</i>
